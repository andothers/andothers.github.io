      Hello, I’m An, originally from Vietnam, now based in Canada. My background is in Geography, and I’m passionate about storytelling.<br><br>
      In my free time, I enjoy watching football (Liverpool F.C and SC Freiburg), taking photographs (with my trusty X-E1), and spending time with my bosses (my wife and my daughter).
